# Source Code for Formulating Node Labelling as Node Classification or Link Prediction in Different Graph Representations

The paper can be found [here](https://openreview.net/forum?id=lK7tjysj0s).

Models can be found in the "models" folder in each dataset category folder. When running the models with the flag `--save_results True`, test scores will be saved under "runs" in the corresponding "models" folder, in a directory named after the timestamp of completion.

## Data
Most of the datasets are available through PyTorch Geometric and will be automatically downloaded when running the models. BlogCat (+ its splits) and DBLP (multi) can be downloaded from [the MLGNC repository](https://github.com/Tianqi-py/MLGNC/tree/main/data).

## Running the scripts
To run the experiments used in the paper, `cd` into the directory of the characteristic you are interested in, make the script executable by running `chmod +x INSERT_SCRIPT_NAME.sh`, and then run it using `./INSERT_SCRIPT_NAME.sh`. The scripts are divided based on model and whether the datasets require batching. For example, if I want to run the experiments on the **homophilic/heterophilic** datasets which **do not require batching**, using the GAT model, I run the following:
```
cd heterophilic_homophilic
chmod +x run_GAT.sh
./run_GAT.sh
```

This will produce a directory called `runs`, with folders containing the results for each dataset, named after the model, dataset and the timestamp of completion. In the folder, results are stored in two `.npy` files per dataset: one containing the NC test scores and one containing the LP test scores of the run.

The shell scripts already contain the flags used in the experiments. Below is a guide of all available flags.

| Flag                   | Description                                                                                                                 |

| `--hidden_channels`    | Number of hidden channels. (Default: 64)                                                                                    |
| `--embedding_size`     | Size of the embedding layer. (Default: 32)                                                                                  |
| `--num_epochs`         | Maximum number of training epochs. (Default: 250)                                                                                   |
| `--lr_NC`              | Learning rate for Node Classification. (Default: 0.01)                                                                       |
| `--lr_LP`              | Learning rate for Link Prediction. (Default: 0.01)                                                                           |
| `--nbr_seeds`          | Number of random seeds to run (starting from 1). (Default: 1)                                                                |
| `--save_results`       | Set to True if results and config should be saved in the `runs` directory. (Default: False)                                 |
| `--two_layers`         | Set to True if you want 2 layers instead of 3 in the models. (Default: False)                                               |
| `--msg_split_ratio`    | Fraction of message passing edges in training for LP (the rest become supervision edges). (Default: 0.3)                    |
| `--ds`                 | Which dataset to run on. (Default: `CiteSeer` for heterophilic/homophilic)                                                                              |
| `--neg_pos_ratio`      | How many times the amount of positive edges should the amount of negative edges be? -1 if all negative edges should be used. (Default: -1) |
